>Click the  Pull Request tab, then from the Pull Request page, click the green New pull request button.
>In the Example Comparisons box, select the branch you made, readme-edits, to compare with main (the original).
>Look over your changes in the diffs on the Compare page, make sure they’re what you want to submit.

MERGING PULL REQUESTS: to the main
